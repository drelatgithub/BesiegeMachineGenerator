## What's it for?

Are you tired of building a massive machine block by block?
Are you frustrated with all those annoying in-game building limitations?
Do you want to create a spectacular scene with tons of explosives without having to build frames just to hold them?

Use this generator now and make your life easier.

## System requirements

Python 3.x is required.

## How to use it?

It is really simple.

- Edit your destination file path in `start.py`.
- Choose the blueprint you want to use in `pkg/build.py`. Alternatively, you can write your own blueprint easily by creating new file in the `pkg/blueprints` module!
